Its a multiplayer, multiplatform OpenGL game which uses TCP and awesomeness.

## How do I build it?

Try these:

### Client (Windows and Others)

Try this as long as you're not on Windows: [instructions](COPIED_GRAPHICS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

Windows? Extract [OpenGL.zip](OpenGL.zip) to your C drive root, then use Visual Studio at your own risk.
